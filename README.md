1. Considering the first graph, I think the most important infromation should be: The difference among careers cause the different income level. However, I have no idea what kind of trend here suggests using the scatter plot. People vary in different value, and the trend line has on meaning here. I would like to show the percentage in this case, which is most people are doing better than their parents, and also their career matters!

2. First, the color is a big problem. We need to know what different colors represent for.   
Second, I don't like tilting my head every time when I see the x-axis, so I turn it into the Y-aixs.
Third, I use a red line to point out the house bubble signal, which seems a pretty important information we need to pay attention.

3.For these three promotion chart. I think the colors are little bit color, so I change some to grey under some circumsatances. And also points out the effective zone.

4. This chart is way too difficult to draw. So I just want to clarify my idea here.
First, it would be better to rank the y-axis in some way which can be shown in some cluster for some specific job categories.  
Second, I would like to use a series color, like from light to dark bule, not rainbow color

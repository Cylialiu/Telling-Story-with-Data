1. Considering the first graph, I think the most important infromation should be: The difference among careers cause the different income level. However, I have no idea what kind of trend here suggests using the scatter plot. People vary in different value, and the trend line has on meaning here. I would like to show the percentage in this case, which is most people are doing better than their parents, and also their career matters!
